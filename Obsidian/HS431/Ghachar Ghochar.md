# Chapter 1 intricacies/ Vincent
* **"Directly in my line of sight is a young woman in blue T-shirt"** 
This character is much similar to the woman(Suhasini) who came to confront Chikkappa !!
also the follow up to one of the narrators question about the incident that unfolded in Coffee House, Vincent answers **"Sir - one story, many sides."**
* **"Words after all are nothing by themselves. They burst into meaning only in the minds they’ve entered."**
This seems like a clue from the author at the writing style. The story-telling unfolds and makes much more sense each time you read it.
* **"There are times when the thought of being there enters my mind just before going to bed, and I pass the night in a dazed half-sleep, eager for morning to arrive."**
* **"She worked for a women’s welfare organization, and would gradually grow incensed as she told me about her day."** narrator talking about Chitra.
* **"She told me about a woman who had been turned out of her house in the middle of the night by her mother-in-law."** 
* **"How can I possibly hide from this all-knowing man the fact that I’m desperate to unburden myself"** after reading this again and now knowing the writing style of the author, I think Vincent himself is a theorization or a clue of the author.
# Chapter 2 intricacies/ Venkatachala
* **‘Will you please mention my name to him?’** this clues that Chikkappa must have known the woman before alongside **‘I’ve brought this because he’s fond of it. It’s masoor dal curry. Please give it to him.’**
* **"Amma and Malati called her a beggar, a whore, and it was clear from the disbelief on her face that she had never been spoken to in this manner."** ~ for Suhasini
* **"On that day I became convinced that it is the words of women that deeply wound other women."** ~  theme
* **‘It’s enough for a man to simply stand there and watch. It’s worse than shouting at her yourself. How could you all pounce on that woman without knowing a thing about her? Is it her fault alone? You should all be ashamed of yourselves. Not one of you had the guts to even hear her out. How could they treat another woman like that?’** this shows Anita's dissent and her rather confronting nature, she stood up for what she thinks is right unlike her very husband.
# Chapter 3 intricacies/ Family
* **"Our only fear now is that he might lose his mind with age and become ruinously entangled in some philanthropic enterprise."**
* **"He’s given to quoting a proverb that says wealth shouldn’t strike suddenly like a visitation, but instead grow gradually like a tree."** 
* **"One glance at his scuffed, dusty shoes was enough to betray the nature of his day’s work."** 
* **"When you have no choice, you have no discontent either."**
* **"Worse, the SM was due to visit in two days’ time. ‘If this isn’t sorted out by then, I’m finished,’ Appa said."** forward propagating detail.
* **‘unimportant matter’** 
* **"Our family had only known a salaried life. This was the first time anyone had thought of starting a business. Sona Masala was created that day in the kitchen. A crucial moment for the family, whose fate would take a sharp turn."**
# Chapter 4 intricacies
* **"Amma, Malati and I – we’re joint-third in the household hierarchy."**
* The smell of fresh paint still lingered. ~ referring to the place they were moving to.
* **‘Don’t ask me for tea again and again simply because it will be quick to make.’** this is a recurring node which connects a lot of the important events, from Malati's house of in-laws to the very end of the story when the whole family comes together.
* **"I suppose initially we did these things only when we were alone, but in time we began to be openly cruel to ants."**
* **"I suppose we too viewed our ascent with a touch of disbelief – could money acquired overnight also not leave with equal haste?"**
# Chapter 5 intricacies/ Malati
* **"We thought of the family as being interdependent: a person who spent money was also taking it away from the others."**
* **"She’d then pick at her food at home, and there would begin a tussle between her and Amma."**
* **"The main actors in that month-long orgy of lavishness were Amma and Malati."**
* **Her mother-in-law wiped off her tears and said, ‘You can’t buy graciousness. It’s something that’s handed down the generations. They say the newly rich carry umbrellas to keep moonlight at bay…’**
* **"I too followed soon after. When I passed the closed door of her room I thought I heard sobs from inside."** 
* **"It isn’t easy for a woman to leave her husband and live in her mother’s house."**
# Chapter 6 intricacies
* **"I sometimes wonder if their every moment is spent sharpening their tongues, silently accumulating resentments for later use. And then, when they’re all in the mood, they’ll whip up a storm that gives me the shivers even to think about."**
* **‘I hope the prince will eat in comfort. So what if the rest of us starve.’**  ~ Anita 
* **"Anita doesn’t like to cook. It’s not that she can’t; she doesn’t want to."**
* **"Of course, I can’t guarantee they’ll say yes. Times have changed, it’s not like the old days …’"** ~ Sripati
* **"Chitra was right when she’d say men were incapable of seeing beyond the bodies of women."** ~ Narrator
* **"The week we spent in Ooty was easily the best time of our life together."**
* **"Anita was also upset when she asked about Malati’s husband and I gave her forthright answers. I didn’t wish to hide anything from her. But her horrified expressions sometimes kept me from telling her everything. "**
* **"I tossed and turned in bed for a long time."** escapism/ Narrator
* **"In this regard she may even have been more fierce than Chitra. And let’s face it: there’s a vast difference in the moral underpinnings of a business family and the household of a salaried teacher"**
# Chapter 7 intricacies
* **"Chikkappa raised his glass of water and gulped it down. He pushed back his chair and left with food still on his plate."**
* **"Appa had raced through his meal without saying a word, and he got up and left."**
* **"The well-being of any household rests on selective acts of blindness and deafness."**
* **"The house had come alive with banter. It was as if Anita’s absence had allowed us to be ourselves, without inhibitions."**
* **"Amma said. ‘Anyway, there is no one else here at the moment. And none of those types who will point out the mustard seed under your feet, but are blind to the pumpkin beneath them.’ It was clear whom she was referring to. Everyone laughed; I too joined in and regretted it even as I did. I had betrayed Anita."**
* **"Malati said, ‘It’s that Suniti murder you’re talking about, isn’t it? The poor fellow was caught despite using two SIM cards to hide his location. She was my friend’s brother’s colleague. Very argumentative at work. And apparently with her in-laws as well. No wonder he was driven to get rid of her.’"**
* **"Appa asked. He looked upset. ‘You’re all talking as if it’s right to kill someone when it suits us.’"**
* **"As usual I hadn’t said anything, but my very silence implicated me."** ~ Narrator
