The art of war is governed by five constant factors, to be taken into account in one's deliberations,
1. The Moral Law
2. Heaven
3. Earth 
4. The Commander
5. Method and Discipline
### The Moral Law : "A principle of harmony"
The moral law causes the people to be complete accord with their ruler, so that they will follow him regardless of their lives undismayed by any danger.
"Without constant practice, the officers will be nervous and undecided when mustering for battle; without constant practice, the general will be wavering and irresolute when the crisis is at hand."

### Heaven 
"Signifies night and day, cold and heat, times and seasons. . . (same for both the parties)"
### Earth
comprises distances, great and small, danger and security, open grounds and narrow passes, the chances of life and death.
### Commander
Stands for the virtues of wisdom, sincerely, benevolence, courage and strictness.
The five cardinal virtues of the Chinese are:
1. humanity or benevolence
2. uprightness of mind
3. self-respect, self-control or "proper-feeling"
4. wisdom
5. sincerity or good faith
### Method and Discipline
To be understood by marshalling the army in its proper subdivisions, the graduation of ranks among the officers, the maintenance of roads by which the supplies are to reach the army and the control of military expenditure.

### Practicality!!
Sun Tzu was a practical soldier.
**He cautions us not to pin our faith to abstract principles.**
### Deception
When able to attack, we must seem inactive, when we are near we must make the enemy feel that we are far away, when we are away we must make the enemy feel that we are close.
