1: (Smiling) Good morning, sir! Lovely day, isn't it?
2: (Scoffs) Don't bother me, young lady. Can't you see I'm busy being miserable?
1: (Undeterred) Oh, but why be miserable? There's so much beauty in the world, even on a cloudy day like this.
2: Ha! Beauty? All I see are clouds, pigeons, and that noisy dog over there.
1: (Looking around) Maybe you need a change of perspective. Sometimes, the best thing to find is what you weren't looking for.
2: (Muttering) Easy for you to say. You probably find happiness in a puddle.
1: (Squints) Speaking of finding things, what's that behind your bench?
2: (Turns and sees a small, wrapped package) Huh. I wonder what that is.
1: Maybe it's a sign! Your missing bit of happiness delivered right to you.
2: (Hesitates, then unfolds the package) Well, I'll be... It's a picture frame. With an empty space for a photo.
1: Looks like it's waiting for a good memory to fill it.
2: (Sighs) Memories are all I have left. My wife used to love filling this house with pictures.
1: Perhaps it's time to make some new ones, then? New memories, new pictures.
2: (Smiles faintly) Maybe you're right, young lady. Maybe there is still some beauty to be found.
1: See? I told you! And hey, if you ever need someone to share those new memories with, I'm always happy to chat with a grumpy old man like you.
2: (Chortles) Don't push your luck, kid. But thanks, anyway.
